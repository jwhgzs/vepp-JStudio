# Way to use

It's pretty easy to use! As you see, there is a displayer on top and a keyboard on bottom.

There are 2 modes for displayer: code mode and output mode. You can switch it by clicking it.

Especially, there is a pointer on the displayer, you can move by specific keys in keyboard (see below) it to view different part of the display code or output: just like rolling your eyeboll!

By the way, the way to output is a bit different: you need to use the built-in function `echo(data)` to output and `clearEcho()` to clear it.
